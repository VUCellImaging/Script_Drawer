# Script_Drawer

This is a collection of various task-specific scripts grouped by language. These scripts were generated during everyday work and might be useful elsewhere. The scripts are available without any guarantees, and a brief description is included in each sub-directory. Enjoy and please let Jenny [jenny.c.schafer at vanderbilt dot edu] or Oleg [oleg.kovtun at vanderbilt dot edu] know if you have any questions!
